# OctoCave (Working game title)

A simple underwater game with a Vector based movement system that accelerates as you continue in a direction and slows down with water resistance.
Play as an octopus traversing the undersea caverns avoiding the enemies along the way.

Runs using python, requires pygame to run
Meant as a learning project, not for commercial use.

Feel free to borrow from the code if it helps you in your own projects.
